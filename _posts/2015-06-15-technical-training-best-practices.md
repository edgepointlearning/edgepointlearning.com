One of our specialties at EdgePoint Learning is technical training, so we thought we'd pass on a few best practices. 

* **Reach employees in the best way possible:** Many technical learners might be in the field or remote, so make sure you're designing learning that they can consume in the easiest and most effective way possible. This means not only on the most suitable device, but also chunked and/or just-in-time learning. 
* **Try social learning:** Technical information by definition can be harder to pass along, so try setting up groups or learning communities where employees can communicate and share the information they know. 
* **SMEs are the key:** Use the subject matter experts at your disposal. They will be infinitely helpful when developing technical training. Check out

* **Keep it up to date:** Technical training might need to be updated at the technology, components, versions or essential information changes. Make sure your training always reflects the most up-to-date material. Learn more about our
