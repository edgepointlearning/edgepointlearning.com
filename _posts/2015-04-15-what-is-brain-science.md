What is brain science? Brain science is, well, pretty much what it sounds like, the study of brain processes and how our minds work.

Where it's cool for the training, eLearning and instructional design industry is that it helps explain how we learn and why we learn the way we do. We can leverage this research to create even better ways to deliver learning; and new science is coming out all the time. Check out a few fun resources:
