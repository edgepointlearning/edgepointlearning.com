Two of our specialties here at EdgePoint Learning are business skills and sales training. Here are a few best practices we’d like to share:

1. **Know your audience.** Not all sales organizations are the same, so be sure you know their needs and expectations before you design or deliver any training. 
2. **Respect time.** Remember that sales people tend to be really busy. All the time they spend training is time theyʹre not selling, so make your training easily accessible and quick.
3. **Scenarios are great.** Try adding scenarios, role playing games and practice engagements to help transfer topics and knowledge.
4. **Sharing is caring.** Create opportunities for the sales organization to share their experiences and ideas. Make sure to record the information shared so you can use it in later sessions.
