Another one of our specialties here at EdgePoint Learning is business skills and sales training So, here are a few best practices we thought we could share:

1. **Know your audience.** Not all sales organizations are the same, so be sure you know their needs and expectations before you design or deliver any training. 
2. **Respect time.** Remember that sales people tend to be really busy and all the time they spend taking training is time they're not selling, so make your training easily accessible and quick.
3. **Scenarios are great.** Try adding scenarios, role play games and practice engagements to help transfer topics and knowledge.
4. **Sharing is caring.** Create opportunities for the sales organization to share their experiences and ideas. Make sure to record the information shared so you can use it later sessions.
