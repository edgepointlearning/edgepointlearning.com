It's always a good idea to evaluate your training strategy at least once a year. Here are a few tips to start the process.

### What are your corporate goals?
It's important that your training program stays in step with your corporate goals as they evolve. Make sure your training team has a voice at the table or at least gets updates when goals change.

### What are your training goals?
Just as your company goals might evolve over time, so will your training goals. Think about what you really need and want from your training program. Has that changed since any training was implemented? Ensure that the training strategy doesn't get stale over time.

### What is your ROI?
This is always a tricky question, but it's one that needs to be asked. Work with your training team to determine good success metrics and make sure they stay aligned to your corporate and training goals.

### Do you still have the right team?
Maybe you need to hire another instructional designer or someone super savvy with mobile learning, but it's always good to make sure the team you have in place is the right one.

### Should you be outsourcing anything?
Sometimes it can be overwhelming to create and implement all the training your organization needs. That's where companies like us can help.
