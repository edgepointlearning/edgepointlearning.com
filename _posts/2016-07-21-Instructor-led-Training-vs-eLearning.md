### In-person or web-based
Instructor-led training (ILT) is the more traditional, formal version of training that takes place in a classroom in front of learners, while eLearning is web-based and can be taken at anytime from an internet-connected device.

### Both have their benefits and their downsides
ILT can incorporate many different styles of learning easily, and in-person training tends to be more personal and helps to build relationships. eLearning is more flexible, though, and learners can refer back to courses over and over.

### The best of both worlds
Blended learning incorporates ILT and eLearning, and it's often utilized to boost the benefits of both.
