Even if you have the best instructional design and training team, you'll sometimes need to outsource your eLearning. But how do you know?

####Resources
If your current resources are fully utilized, you might want to consider outsourcing some eLearning projects to keep your team from being overwhelmed. Also, if your team is missing a critical skill or special expertise, you can look elsewhere to get the job done.

####Time
Say you have a time-sensitive project that needs to get done as soon as possible. Sometimes the best course of action is to outsource that project to ensure it gets done on time.

####One-offs
If you get a requirement that's not necessarily part of your normal routine, such as a highly produced video or user interface design, you will probably want to take that project to an expert who can get it done quickly and correctly. Or if your one-off project is just clogging up the normal process, it might be a good idea to outsource it.
