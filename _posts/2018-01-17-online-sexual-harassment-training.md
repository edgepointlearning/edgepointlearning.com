The recent spate of sexual harassment allegations across industries in the U.S. has brought the ongoing, pervasive existence of sexual harassment in the workplace back into the spotlight. Many companies have responded by increasing their offering of sexual harassment trainings, a good first step. But what makes online sexual harassment training after the #MeToo movement effective?

### Who is #MeToo, and what does it all mean?

More than just a hashtag, [the #MeToo movement](https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2017/12/06/568773208/-metoo-movement-is-person-of-the-year-time-says){:target="_blank"} is a tidal wave of women (and men) standing up for themselves and against a pervasive culture of harassment. It was first used by social activist [Tarana Burke](http://justbeinc.wixsite.com/justbeinc/the-me-too-movement-cmml){:target="_blank"}, and recently popularized by actress Alyssa Milano who encouraged women to use the hashtag if they had been harassed.

Responses flooded in, with the number of hashtags climbing into the thousands within hours. Each #MeToo represents an incidence of harassment, but it’s difficult to pinpoint actual statistics on sexual harassment. The numbers vary wildly depending on [industry](https://www.vox.com/identities/2017/11/21/16685942/sexual-harassment-industry-service-retail){:target="_blank"}, [race](https://www.thenation.com/article/sexual-harassment-law-was-shaped-by-the-battles-of-black-women/){:target="_blank"}, [socioeconomic status](https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/d3yn7m/working-women-and-the-sexual-harassment-we-dont-hear-about){:target="_blank"}, and [age group](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/sexual-assault-statistics_us_58e24c14e4b0c777f788d24f){:target="_blank"}. These numbers also rely on reporting, which for many victims is just not possible.

#MeToo doesn't shine a spotlight into something that's "just" an annoyance to the millions of (typically) women who suffer from harassment. For example, victims have to consider whether or not to skip meetings where they know a harasser will be present. They have to turn down certain clients or projects or business trips, threatening their careers. They're forced to decide whether or not it's worth reporting a harasser when their livelihood and personal career goals are on the line. And that's all before considering the very real and personal risks to their health, safety, mental health, and bodily autonomy that victims endure.

Simply put, online sexual harassment training has not been an effective way of protecting these victims, as the #MeToo movement is showing.

### How can you make online sexual harassment training effective?

Effective online anti-harassment training means more than sitting employees in front of a screen and saying, “Don’t do it.”
In fact, a small study found that in one company, men in sexual harassment trainings were [less likely to report sexual harassment](http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0021886301372001){:target="_blank"} and more likely to blame the victim. Design better and more effective online sexual harassment training with these eight steps.

*  Create the right culture, starting at the top
*  Consider your audience
*  Choose the right format
*  Listen to victims
*  Make your company's policy on sexual harassment crystal clear
*  Make online harassment training for employees ongoing
*  Back away from the time machine
*  Go beyond compliance

Let's explore more about each of these.

#### Step 1: Create the right culture, and it absolutely has to start at the top

Effective online sexual harassment training is not just about changing behavior –it’s about changing minds.

Mindset starts at the top with company executives that believe in the value of all employees, regardless of gender or job. This includes not only telling employees they are valuable but also showing them. For example, [less than 5% of Fortune 500 companies are headed by a female CEO](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/07/13/weber-shandwick-female-ceo_n_7771608.html){:target="_blank"}. Look for opportunities to [promote and recognize women at all levels](https://hbr.org/2017/11/training-programs-and-reporting-systems-wont-end-sexual-harassment-promoting-more-women-will){:target="_blank"}.

It’s not just about quantity, though; it’s quality.

It’s important that company executives listen to complaints and take them seriously, regardless of where they come from. Doing this begins with a clear policy for reporting sexual harassment, even (and especially) when it involves the highest levels of the company.

Don't be the company where everyone "knew" about one shady company leader, but no one in HR took the steps to approach the issue thoughtfully and proactively.

#### Step 2: Consider your audience

Rolling out training to the whole company may make sense from an efficiency standpoint, but you are also looking for effectiveness. Your message may be lost on a large group of people.

Consider smaller groups of people for trainings to make it a safer space for everyone to hear the message and ask questions.

#### Step 3: Choose the right format

An hour-long lecture on sexual harassment isn’t what your employees need. Even with limited access to formal research, [it’s clear that traditional sexual harassment trainings don’t work](http://www.motherjones.com/media/2017/11/theres-little-evidence-sexual-harassment-trainings-work/){:target="_blank"}.

What has been proven more effective is small bits of information delivered in a personal way. [Microlearning](https://www.edgepointlearning.com/blog/microlearning) can include testimonials of victims of harassment or definitions of harassment that include those dealing with race, age, disability, or national origin.

Go beyond corporate compliance and give your employees the tools they need to better identify what sexual harassment really looks like in the workplace.

#### Step 4: Listen to victims

If the #MeToo movement has brought up the prevalence of sexual harassment in general it has also specifically pointed out a curious feature of many sexual harassment claims and the reason why so many harassed people remain silent: victim blaming.

Listening to victims is a crucial part of this equation that leads to fewer incidences of harassment. How? Victims who know they will be believed are more likely to come forward. Potential harassers will see the potential consequences of their actions and change their behavior.

Prove your company is listening by setting up a clear system for reporting sexual harassment that includes who to report to, clear actions that will be taken during a complaint, and the time frame for investigating a complaint.

#### Step 5: Make your company’s policy on sexual harassment crystal clear

There should be no “grey” areas, no murky waters.

Use microlearning and online sexual harassment training modules to spell out exactly what harassment is and when a behavior crosses the line. These means taking a hard look at what may already be in place and modifying all training materials as needed.

#### Step 6: Make online harassment training for employees ongoing

From the employee onboarding to the end of their retirement from the company, anti-harassment training should be an ongoing, [proactive](https://www.tlnt.com/how-to-use-predictive-analytics-to-prevent-workplace-sexual-harassment/){:target="_blank"}, and regular part of employee training.

#### Step 7: Back away from the time machine

Sexual harassment in the 21st century is not the same as it was in the 20th.

While the intentions behind harassment may be the same, the approach might look different. If you are still using examples from Mad Men in your anti-harassment training, it’s time to [update your training toolbox](https://moneyish.com/ish/this-is-exactly-how-much-our-workplace-sexual-harassment-views-have-changed-in-20-years/){:target="_blank"}.

#### Step 8: Go beyond compliance

Sure, you could post a couple videos and make employees take a quiz to check on their comprehension, but that’s not really changing anything.

Go beyond mere compliance and design an online sexual harassment training that makes a difference in your company. Companies whose [employees feel valued and protected](https://www.ft.com/content/6081b1fc-d0b2-11e5-92a1-c5e23ef99c77){:target="_blank"} are more successful. Your anti-harassment trainings should reinforce your employees’ worth, not just be one more box to check off.

### How can training leaders prevent harassment?

Professor Vicki Magley is one of the few psychologists who studies sexual harassment trainings and their effectiveness, and her findings are crystal clear:

<cite>"[[Effective training is] about the climate](http://www.businessinsider.com/sexual-harassment-training-effective-2017-11){:target="_blank"}. When employees perceived that their company was ethical, their knowledge improved and their attitudes changed as a result of the harassment prevention training... they take it seriously because they think that the organization is taking it seriously.”</cite>

Sexual harassment training for leaders in a company sends a signal that your company takes harassment allegations seriously, so seriously that it’s worth their time to refresh their own understanding of it.
