An employee-owned firm of scientists, planners and technical specialists, **SWCA Environmental Consultants** combines scientific knowledge and technical expertise to create solutions for a wide variety of environmental projects. The Company has 30 offices throughout the U.S. and the Pacific Islands, which gives them the ability to quickly respond to clients in a number of sectors, including energy generation, oil and gas, mining, federal land management, Department of Defense, transmission and transportation.

## The Challenge
SWCA Environmental Consultants didn’t have a standardized employee onboarding process, so each office executed the task very differently, if at all. The Company needed to educate new hires on SWCA’s values, mission and culture in a consistent manner, and they realized that the only way to achieve this goal was via eLearning programs that could be readily accessed anywhere in the world.

## The Solution
EdgePoint Learning created self-paced new employee orientation programs that featured consistent information reflective of the Company's core values and culture, including modules that explained employee benefits, basic policies and procedures, and OSHA and safety requirements. Additionally, EdgePoint Learning worked with the Company to find a tool that would allow them to make updates to the modules independently, as needed.

## The Results
After the eLearning modules were released, the Company realized timely and consistent onboarding of new employees, resulting in rapid and effective organizational assimilation. With new hires now armed with a clear understanding of the Company’s core values and culture from day one, new hire retention rates increased dramatically. Additionally, overall feedback from employees was positive, with many expressing how it helped them recognize their value to the organization.
