**La Quinta’s** portfolio consists of 878 hotels representing over 87,000 rooms located in 47 U.S. states, Canada, Mexico and Honduras. According to STR, the leading global provider of research to the hotel industry, La Quinta was, as of December 2014, the fastest growing hotel brand among its competitors in terms of percentage growth of number of hotels in the U.S. La Quinta is owned by La Quinta Holdings Inc., a leading owner, operator and franchisor of midscale and upper-midscale hotels.

### The Challenge
With customer service of paramount importance to the brand, La Quinta wanted a series of courses that would empower their associates to better serve their guests, one that could be delivered via both tablets and desktops. As it was the Company's first time developing mobile content, they needed a collaborator who was prepared to learn and design alongside them. Additionally, the Company needed help selecting a third-party, non-proprietary tool that would allow them to make content updates in-house and on their own, and they wanted a flexible, innovative partner to help them do it.

### The Solution
EdgePoint Learning worked with La Quinta to investigate a number of
candidate tools, identify the potential and limitations of each, narrow the list
down to a small group of finalists and select the best solution for the Company’s needs. EdgePoint Learning then created modules with interactive practice activities that provided associates with best practices for guest check-in, plus software training and simulations.

### The Results
La Quinta’s front desk processes were streamlined and the check-in experience for guests was significantly improved.
