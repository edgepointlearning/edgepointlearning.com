**Bloomin' Brands** is one of the world's largest casual dining companies, with some 100,000 employees and nearly 1,500 restaurants throughout 48 states, Puerto Rico, Guam and 22 countries. The Company includes Outback Steakhouse, Carrabba’s Italian Grill, Bonefish Grill and Fleming’s Prime Steakhouse & Wine Bar. In 2012, Bloomin’ Brands, Inc. became a publicly traded company on NASDAQ under the ticker symbol “BLMN.”

##The Challenge
To improve succession planning, Bloomin' Brands launched a new education initiative, Lessons in Leadership, which would feature the Company’s top-level managers recounting their career experiences for other managers and management hopefuls. To start, the Company needed an existing, raw video featuring the CEO converted into a more engaging format that they could deliver through their learning management system. This pilot would set the tone, look and feel for subsequent presentations by other top-level managers.

##The Solution
EdgePoint Learning created video-based mentoring modules that leveraged existing media assets, enhanced them with images and animated text, and broke them up into lessons. EdgePoint Learning then enabled cross- platform delivery of the content.

##The Results
The new initiative was embraced by managers across the organization and expanded to include all employees, not just managers and management hopefuls. Feedback was overwhelmingly positive, with employees describing the modules as engaging, enjoyable and leaving them craving more content in the same format.
