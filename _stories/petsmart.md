**PetSmart** employs over 50,000 associates, owns over 1,400 pet stores in the U.S., Canada and Puerto Rico, and operates over 200 in-store pet-boarding facilities. The world’s largest specialty retailer of pet services and solutions, PetSmart offers a wide variety of competitively priced pet products, and provides training, grooming, daycare and in-store pet adoption services. PetSmart is owned by BC Partners, a private equity firm specializing in buyouts and acquisitions in the U.S. and Europe.

##The Challenge
Historically, all of PetSmart’s employee training was conducted in-store and face-to-face. But with the Company’s continued growth and the mounting cost of sending trainers out into field, PetSmart recognized the value that eLearning could bring to their organization. They needed a partner to jumpstart an eLearning program and rapidly build out a content library, despite the limited bandwidth of the hardware available in-store.

##The Solution
EdgePoint Learning delivered to employees via in-store training labs some 50 hours of interactive eLearning modules that covered approximately 30 topics, including customer service, sales, safety, product categories, policy procedure and new hire orientation.

##The Results
PetSmart employees quickly embraced the training, appreciative of the opportunity to work at home at their own pace or in-store during their off hours. The Company found that they were able to onboard new employees faster than ever before, noted a significant increase in productivity and customer satisfaction numbers, and realized a significant decrease in travel costs. This success marked the beginning of an eLearning era for PetSmart: the Company went on to recruit EdgePoint Learning into a co-development relationship in which PetSmart developed and storyboarded instructional content, and EdgePoint Learning transformed that content into eLearning modules.
