**WebPT** offers a cloud-based electronic medical records software for use in physical therapy practices, which enables practices to operate more efficiently and comply with Medicare, HIPPA, and ICD-10 regulations.
Intended for use by all members of the practice on both computers and mobile devices, the WebPT Software as a Service (SaaS) model seamlessly integrates documentation, business reporting, scheduling, billing, and one-stop shopping to related products and services.

##The Challenge
After sub-optimal results were experienced with phone-based and live software demonstrations for their new account rollouts, WebPT sought to improve their customer implementation and end user training experience by providing self-paced online training early on in the implementation process.  

WebPT determined that such an approach would increase customer end users’ success and comfort using the product, as well as reduce the volume of support calls. However, the company did not possess the resources in- house to execute this Customer Success strategy.  

##The Solution
Self-paced eLearning course, blending WebPT software simulation with “safe practice,” interactive exercises.

EdgePoint Learning evaluated existing WebPT training content from recorded live demonstrations and rapidly transformed the existing assets into a series of eLearning modules – each targeted at specific aspects of and job roles within a typical physical therapy practice.

Key advantages of an asynchronous training approach included time and cost savings for both WebPT and its customers, while providing customer end users with a scalable, on-demand demonstration on how to use the software.

In addition, “anytime, anywhere” access to the courseware provided ongoing performance support for customer end users, greatly minimizing the need to contact WebPT technical support.

##The Results
Five hours of interactive multimedia eLearning content was developed from the ground up within a single quarter. WebPT’s customer implementation timeline was reduced by 30%. Volume of support calls was reduced by 86%, per clinic per month.

The initiative also drove a 50% reduction in training team labor time (and associated costs) — from 4.5 hours of live training per clinic to 2 hours of live training per clinic.
