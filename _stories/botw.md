**Bank of the West** operates more than 700 branch banking and commercial office locations in 19 western and midwestern states. Prudent credit underwriting, a diversified loan portfolio, and careful risk management has allowed the bank to grow to $58 billion in assets. It is one of the nation’s largest banks, yet it preserves its local feel and its award-winning style of relationship banking that ensures superior customer service. Bank of the West is owned by BNP Paribas, one of the largest financial companies in the world.

### The Challenge
The Compliance Project initiative involved transforming 50 instructor-led training classes in major regulatory areas for financial institutions into seven highly interactive, exciting, and engaging online courses.

### The Solution
EdgePoint recommended an interactive course design, rather than force-feeding the audience an overwhelming amount of information via “voice over PowerPoint.” The online courses featured accurate (and relatable) characters talking directly to the employees, as well as to the other characters in the scenarios, clearly explaining how to apply compliance regulations on the job. The design included core modules applicable to all employees and department specific modules that highlighted multiple case studies.

### The Results
EdgePoint Learning enabled Bank of the West to rapidly develop and deliver 47 interactive compliance case studies to 15 different departments across their global enterprise. EdgePoint Learning’s instructional design expertise, storyboarding process and content development have created a repeatable, rapid development framework for the Company as new regulations are put into law or existing ones updated.
