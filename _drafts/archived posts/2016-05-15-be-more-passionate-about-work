One of our core values is Passion:

>“Our goal is to continually exceed our customer’s expectations by delivering creative solutions that align with organizational learning challenges. We supplement that with a passion for customer service and ultimately become a virtual extension of your organization, delivering the same dedication to excellence and attention to detail that you would expect from a trusted team member.”

What can you do to be more passionate about your work? We have a few ideas:

* First, watch the documentary [Jiro Dreams of Sushi](http://bit.ly/WsNPe6). It’s streaming on Netflix; you have no excuse!
* Then read this article, [L](http://bit.ly/WsOaNY)[essons We Can Learn from Jiro Ono.](http://bit.ly/WsOaNY).
* There’s even a book about it: [The Passion Plan.](http://bit.ly/WsPb8N)
* But nobody sums it up better than Steve Jobs:

>"Your work is going to fill a large part of your life, and the only way to be truly satisfied is to do what you believe is great work. And the only way to do great work is to love what you do. If you haven’t found it yet, keep looking. Don’t settle."
