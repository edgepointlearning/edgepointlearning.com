If you have not considered suicide prevention training in the past, think about it now during National Suicide Prevention Month

September is [National Suicide Prevention Month](https://suicidepreventionlifeline.org/promote-national-suicide-prevention-month/). If you have not considered suicide prevention training in the past, take a moment to think about it now. Gatekeepers in healthcare, community work, education, and many other fields all need to be informed about and trained in suicide prevention. From recognizing people at risk to the steps to report, this training is a crucial part of keeping people safe. 

## What is suicide prevention training? 

Suicide prevention training works to help people recognize risk factors for suicide and to take steps to help those in need. Although there is lingering stigma about discussing many aspects of mental health, suicide prevention training is crucial. It is critical. And, it is imperative that we drive appropriate discussions whenever we have the chance. 

Consider these stats.

* Death by suicide has risen 24% in the past 15 years
* The increase has occurred [across all genders, races, and age groups](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2016/04/22/suicide-rate-rise-us/83284568/)
* Girls between 10 and 14 years of age have seen a 200% increase (suicide is the third leading cause of death in this age group)
* Men in all age groups are four times as likely to commit suicide

The U.S. Centers for Disease Control (CDC) agrees that [prevention is key](https://www.cdc.gov/violenceprevention/pdf/asap_suicide_issue2-a.pdf) to reducing the rate of suicide. This means providing suicide prevention training to gatekeepers in the community. Gatekeepers are people who have direct contact with those who are most at risk of suicide. Examples of gatekeepers include [educators](https://teenlifeline.org/teen-topics/educators/), human resources directors, and managers who might notice changes in employee behavior or engagement. In some cases, even a trusted co-worker can be in a position to recognize at-risk behavior and offer support.

## Which topics should I cover in our suicide prevention training? 

Suicide prevention training can be conducted in-person or online. Regardless of how it is delivered, there are a few key common elements, or topics, to discuss in each training. You can also supplement it with [mental health training](/blog/mental-health-training/), which is covered in an earlier post. 

Note that some professionals will have additional, intensive training on key topics. 

### Demystifying suicide

One of the main reasons people who are suffering do not seek help is due to a lingering stigma surrounding suicide. 

A suicide prevention training can help to [dispel myths about suicide](https://www.aetna.com/health-guide/suicide-myths-and-facts.html) and suicide prevention. This process can help those in the training to understand why someone might be reluctant to seek help and to take steps to draw them out.

### Identifying risk factors

In the majority of cases, there are clearly identifiable risk factors for suicide. Some of these include:

* Previous suicide attempts
* A family history of suicide or mental disorders
* History of drug and alcohol use/abuse
* Access to lethal weapons
* Traumatic life experiences
* Social isolation

Not everyone who has the above risk factors will attempt suicide. Those who do attempt to take their lives often have many of the most common risk factors. Suicide prevention training helps gatekeepers recognize the difference between someone who is having an “off day” and when there is cause for concern.

### Noticing warning signs

The warning signs of suicide may seem much clearer after the fact. Suicide prevention training, though, clarifies behavior that indicate a person could be moving towards action. 

Warning signs might include a loss of interest, personality changes, and giving away important possessions (among others).

### Structuring language

People who are reluctant to discuss suicide with an at-risk person may be worried about saying the “wrong thing.” They might be concerned that their words could be harmful. Suicide prevention training teaches how to approach the topic with an at-risk person in a way that is open and inviting (or at the very least neutral). 

[Positive conversation starters](https://www.helpguide.org/articles/suicide-prevention/suicide-prevention.htm) like, “I've been worried about you and wanted to check in,” or “How can I offer support right now?” can go a long way to start a conversation that could save a person’s life.

Language is important in another way. The language we use when talking about suicide can be helpful, but it can also be harmful. Avoid certain phrases that stigmatize suicide, such as "committed suicide" as it positions the act as a crime, or suicide attempts as "successful" or "unsuccessful." Instead, opt for the term "died by suicide" in most cases. 

Further, there is some indication that suicide attempts increase among at-risk people when certain types of language are used. To that end, developing a reporting and communications strategy within your company is important even before you design training. This might include guidelines on avoiding:

* Depiction of the suicide (including location or method)
* How much personal detail is included (if any)
* Speculation about why a person took their life (or disclosing the contents of a suicide note)
* Portraying suicide as the only response to a person’s hardship

The goal here is to be supportive of those who are vulnerable to suicide—not to reinforce their ideas about it. For course developers, learn more of the guidelines for writing on suicide [here](https://reportingonsuicide.org/recommendations/#dodonts). 

### Gathering resources

The [National Suicide Prevention Line](https://suicidepreventionlifeline.org/) is a toll-free, 24/7 lifeline for people who need to talk to someone immediately. Their team is trained and available to talk at any time of day or night, all across the globe. In Arizona, [Teen Lifeline](https://teenlifeline.org/) offers phone or text support for teens, their parents, and community.

These hotlines are just one of the many types of resources that are available to people in distress. Many communities will have their own local hotlines or support resources. Suicide prevention training helps employees gather resources so they have them ready if needed.

### Reporting an issue

Arguably the hardest call to make is one that occurs in an emergency situation. This situation arises when it is clear that a person has the intent, the means, and the desire to take their life. In this case, gatekeepers must recognize these signs and [know how to act](https://psychcentral.com/lib/what-to-do-when-you-think-someone-is-suicidal/), and quickly.

Suicide prevention training also helps employees know when and how to report issues that are not necessarily an emergency (but that still require intervention or attention).
