[Microlearning](/blog/microlearning/) is quick, accessible learning that offers your employees tidbits of information when they need it, where they need it. What are the different types of microlearning that you can use for your employees to meet your training goals?

## What is microlearning?

Microlearning uses rich media that is available across multiple devices to engage and inspire learners to dig deeper. More than just a larger eLearning course split into pieces, microlearning encourages the learner to apply what they learn immediately.

The different types of microlearning offer tremendous benefit to employees who are already pressed for time, including:

* <strong>Microlearning is effective:</strong> There is a 17% improvement in [knowledge transfer](http://blog.commlabindia.com/elearning-development/byte-sized-learning){:target="_blank"} when learning is broken into smaller chunks

* <strong>Microlearning promotes engagement:</strong> [Mobile learners](https://elearningindustry.com/mobile-devices-for-microlearning-and-spaced-learning){:target="_blank"} study an additional 40 minutes per week, on their own time

* <strong>Microlearning is the format of choice for many:</strong> 50% of [college-going Millennials](https://elearningindustry.com/engage-millennials-in-the-workplace-3-examples-microlearning-gamification-social-learning){:target="_blank"} are not in favor of physical classroom learning

* <strong>Microlearning is efficient:</strong> [Microlearning resources](http://info.shiftelearning.com/blog/numbers-dont-lie-why-bite-sized-learning-is-better-for-your-learners-and-you-too){:target="_blank"} take 300% less time and 50% less cost to produce than traditional courses

## Top types of microlearning

There are 11 major types of microlearning you can choose from, including:

Interactive parallax-based scrolling

1. Videos

### Interactive parallax-based scrolling

As an employee’s avatar scrolls through an online scenario, interactive quizzes, questions, and information pops up to check for their understanding.

Much like a maze or world-building game, this type of microlearning is highly engaging for [learners with a short attention span](http://time.com/3858309/attention-spans-goldfish/){:target="_blank"}.

### Videos

Animated videos and whiteboard videos can stand alone or be offered as part of a microlearning course.

Both are an engaging way to:

* Explain an abstract idea
* Provide step-by-step procedures for more visual learners
* Animated text with audio can also fall under the category of videos, providing a different take for those who prefer text.

### Infographics

Infographics offer at-a-glance information that can be useful for summarizing key points from a longer training.

Interactive infographics can also be linked to more information, deepening the training whenever an employee is ready to learn more. This type of microlearning can be part of the employee onboarding process to get new employees quickly up to speed on company policies and procedures.

### Static resources

Static resources may not be as flashy as some of the other types of microlearning, but they are one of the most widely utilized formats. Think PDFs and eBooks accessed across devices that offer quick summaries that go deeper than an infographic.

eBooks may not obviously fit the ideals of microlearning tools in that they generally take longer to read, but they can be there as a reference when employees need it. As with infographics, PDFs and eBooks can be designed as interactive for more depth of information at your employee's fingertips.

### Simulations

Simulations are a powerful microlearning tool to get employees used to performing a task before they have to perform it.

One of the most well-known examples of simulation is a flight simulator. Most pilots spend time in a flight simulator before they step foot in the cockpit. This allows them to troubleshoot disaster scenarios and fail without endangering passengers.

Your company may not be training pilots, but imagine this application in designing earthquake-proof buildings. The risk is low, but the reward is tremendous. Other examples may include emergency situations, common procedures for healthcare workers, responding to a phishing attempt in a financial company, and more.

Simulations offer employees a way to try and fail in safety.

### Complex branching scenarios

Imagine a simulator that is like a choose-your-own-adventure book. This interactive microlearning tool responds and reacts to an employee’s choices as they make them, changing the situation.

Imagine this as a customer service training tool, with the interactive tool acting as a customer, raising objections or filing a complaint. Or as an emergency room simulation with factors changing all the time. Microlearning like this offers multiple opportunities for problem solving in different scenarios.

### Podcasts and webcasts

Especially if your employees spend time on the road, podcasts can be a remarkably effective microlearning tool.

Podcasts can be short or long, basic and to the point or a discussion of theories. Similarly, webcasts offer a more visual approach and, if viewed live, also allow questions from the viewer that are then answered in real time.

### Gamification

Who says training needs to be boring? Gamification is a type of microlearning that helps employees learn concepts while playing a game.
Badges, levels, social interaction, and competition can all be incorporated into the game.

### Social learning

If you thought social media was just for protest and pictures of your dinner, think again.
Social media learning programs reaches a wide audience for short but thoughtful discussions and interactions. Company trainers can offer materials on an internal social network, and employees from all over the world can connect on a daily basis to check in.

### Geofencing

Cast a wide net with your microlearning – or don’t. Geofencing allows you to send training in the form of push notifications to employees when they need them in a specific geographic location.

Imagine your employees enter a jobsite and need just-in-time information on changes to regulations or building codes. Geofencing sends an automatic update to their device so they have the information when they need it most.

### Performance Support Tools (PSTs) or job aids

PSTs – think checklists, quick-fix videos, or definitions – can help employees maintain a consistent quality standard when completing a task. This type of microlearning is targeted to specific objectives for specific performance-based tasks.
