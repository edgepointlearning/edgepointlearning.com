      <p>Companies large and small know how important high-quality training is to the success of their business, but not everyone knows how to get there. An eLearning consultant can help you make sense of all your options to develop training that fits your company, your vision, and your overall goals.</p>
      <p>At EdgePoint Learning, our team is made up of expert eLearning consultants who can help you design the best training programs for your company. From designing one stand-alone module to designing a new training program to a complete overhaul of your company’s approach to employee training, we can help.</p>
      
      <h2>Your guide to better eLearning</h2>
      <p>Our eLearning consultants work with you to create a plan for small or large-scale training initiatives. We start with an in-depth analysis of your team's responsibilities and current training to identify which roles and what people in them need what type of training.</p>
      <p>Then, we help you develop a learning program that takes a blended learning approach. Your final program may include any mix of the following, depending on your needs:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Custom eLearning courses</li>
        <li>Instructor-led training resources</li>
        <li><a href="/blog/microlearning/">Microlearning guides</a></li>
        <li>Mobile job aids powered by <a href="/blog/geofencing/">geofencing</a></li>
      </ul>
      <p>Our innovative and research-based learning program design helps you match your goals and objectives with the right learning strategies for your employees.</p>
      <p>We help you develop quality content with our years of eLearning expertise and innovation, using your company’s goals as our guide. We listen to your needs and respond to your wants. As your eLearning consultant, we are with you every step of the way.</p>
      
      <h2>Our process</h2>
      <p>Some eLearning consulting firms don’t take the time to get to know your company before offering you a cookie-cutter approach to training. That’s not us.</p>
      <p>The first step we take with you is helping you define your training strategy with a <a href="/blog/training-needs-analysis/">training needs analysis.</a> This guides goal and objective setting based on what your employees need to know to be successful and their strengths and weaknesses.</p>
      <p>Next, we look at a variety of approaches that can help you meet your goals. We won’t ever hand you a stuffy three-ring binder or email you a PowerPoint and call it done.</p>
      <p>Our training options include research-based learning interventions designed to deliver information in an engaging and creative way. We know every company is different, which means what works for one might not work for all. Our goal is to find an approach that matches your company and your employees, not cram you into a one-size-fits-all box.</p>
      <p>Once we are there, we make sure whatever training option you choose is flexible and nimble enough to grow and change with your company. As technologies change, your training should change, too. We leave space for growth and integration into new platforms.</p>
