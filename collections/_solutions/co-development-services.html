        <h2>Our approach to eLearning development</h2>
        <p>At EdgePoint Learning, our approach to eLearning development focuses on three key points: collaboration, engagement, and expert design.</p>

        <h3>Collaboration</h3>
        <p>Our collaborative approach is one of the hallmarks of the EdgePoint Learning experience. We understand that creating successful partnerships relies on open, honest, and frequent communication.</p>
        <p>We are always working with your goals in mind to produce innovative, high-quality training on your schedule.</p>

        <h3>Engagement</h3>
        <p>The best employee training meets employees where they are, whether they  need <a href="/blog/microlearning/">microlearning</a> resources right on their <a href="/blog/what-is-mlearning/">phones</a> or full corporate compliance programs with a blended <a href="/blog/instructor-led-training-vs-elearning/">online and instructor-led</a> approach.</p>
        <p>You can’t teach who you can’t reach. We help you design engaging training that is thoughtful and impactful for employees.</p>

        <h3>Expert design</h3>
        <p>Our team brings foundational knowledge in instructional design that, when combined with your subject matter experts, results in a logical progression of training that works.</p>
        <p>EdgePoint Learning’s learner-centered instructional design practices set us apart from other experts. We utilize eLearning development best practices to create trainings that give your business the competitive edge, while relying on research-tested approaches to adult learning and knowledge acquisition.</p>
