      <h2>What we do</h2>
      <p>Some eLearning consulting firms don’t take the time to get to know your company before offering you a cookie-cutter approach to training. That’s not us.</p>
      <p>We first help you define your training strategy with a training needs analysis. This guides our goals based on your current business processes and challenges, along with what your employees need to know to be successful and incorporate learning into the flow of work.</p>
      <p>Next, we look at approaches that can help you meet those goals. We won’t ever hand you a stuffy three-ring binder or email you a PowerPoint and call it done. Instead, we'll introduce the latest learning technologies, like location-based solutions, mobile-first learning, augmented reality, and machine learning, to develop enjoyable and engaging learning experiences.</p>
      <p>Then, we'll make sure whatever training approach you choose is flexible and nimble enough to grow and change with your company. As technologies change, your training should change, too.</p>
