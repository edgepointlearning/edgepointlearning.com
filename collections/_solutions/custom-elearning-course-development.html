      <h2>We make custom eLearning course development easy</h2>
      <p>Anyone can download a PowerPoint or .pdf and send out in an email, but is that going to get you the results you want? Probably not.</p>
      <p>Knowing where to begin is half the battle. We work with you to create custom eLearning solutions that match your needs and meet your goals.</p>

<!-- TO-DO: The following H3s could be broken into separate boxes with graphics  -->
      <h3>Exceptional level of service</h3>
      <p>You need us, and we are there – before, during, and after creating your custom eLearning course. Creating quality eLearning courses means listening to your concerns and helping you make sense of what comes next.</p>

      <h3>Development at your pace</h3>
      <p>Our talented course instructional designers and multimedia talent can work with content you already have or create courses from scratch that are meaningful, useful, and motivational for your employees.</p>
      
      <h3>Flexibility</h3>
      <p>Business is changing, and your eLearning courses should be able to roll with the punches. Whether you are training five employees or 500, we can create courses with flexible delivery models that meet the needs of your staff.</p>
      
      <h3>Nimble</h3>
      <p>We move with you, creating just-in-time solutions for whatever challenges you encounter in your day. Need to move in a different direction? We pivot with you, piloting new ideas and helping you to continually improve your training programs.</p>
      
      <h3>Creativity</h3>
      <p>eLearning shouldn’t be stuffy. After all, isn’t the goal to engage employees and increase their skills? Our learner-centered approach offer creative eLearning courses with multiple solutions to attract (and sustain!) employee attention.</p>
      
      <h2>Modern approaches to eLearning</h2>
      <p>We aren’t looking to recreate something that you know doesn’t work. Our cutting-edge approach to custom eLearning includes something for every company’s needs.</p>
      
      <h3>Video and Gamification</h3>
      <p>Your workforce is getting younger, and their idea of a quality training is shifting. Learning that includes video and elements of <a href="/blog/gamification-in-elearning/">gamification</a> creatively engages and trains employees with clear goals and measurable outcomes.</p>
      
      <h3>Microlearning</h3>
      <p>Microlearning means your employees can get what they need no matter where they are or which device they use. Small bites of training delivered on-the-go means capturing employee attention with valuable insights when they need it most.</p>
      
      <h3>Simulations and on-the-job training</h3>
      <p>When it comes to learning new skills and reinforcing old ones, nothing beats guided practice. With simulations and on-the-job, just-in-time training, custom eLearning can change employee behavior while delivering content employees need.</p>
