      <p>At EdgePoint Learning, we know that a highly-successful learning program can have a measurable impact on your company's, team's, or employeesâ€™ overall performance.</p>
      <p>We know this because we've seen it happen time and time again with our clients.</p>
      <p>For example, one client saw an 86% reduction in support calls after rolling out a self-paced software simulation eLearning course. Another realized a significant increase in new hire retention rates from a consistent onboarding program.</p>
