      <h2 class="h3">Training Solutions Designed for Your Company</h2>
      <p>Because we listen at EdgePoint Learning, we know that not every workforce needs a custom eLearning course.</p>
      <p>Some workforces need the structure and space for other types of training like self-study materials, practice scenarios, microlearning, and performance support materials. Others just need help with specific tasks while developing their own training.</p>
      <p>Not ready to dive into developing training just yet? Maybe you’re an organization that needs the knowledge and expertise of our consulting team to help you craft an entire training initiative.</p>
      <p class="marginBot">Whatever your unique goals are, EdgePoint Learning can craft a solution that works for you from planning, to development, and delivering your training. See how we can help your organization with:</p>
