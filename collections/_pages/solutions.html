      <p>At EdgePoint Learning, we listen. We know it makes a difference when we accurately pinpoint your needs and wants from the beginning and translate those into your finished eLearning product.</p>
      <p>Whether your organization is a small- or medium-sized business, multinational corporation or non-profit, good learning equals good business.</p>
      <p>Your employees need access to training and continued career growth in order to succeed. That's true whether they're out in the field for an energy company, directly working with patients for a healthcare organization, or making key business decisions from the C-suite.</p>
      <p>The right training program empowers all of your employees—from your front-line to your executives—to make decisions that promote safety, efficiency, and productivity. It also makes that training available right at their point of need, providing mobile-ready solutions wherever they go.</p>
      <p>EdgePoint Learning makes that happen with our comprehensive training solutions.</p>

      <h2 class="h3 marginTop">Training Solutions Designed for Your Company</h2>
      <p>Because we listen at EdgePoint Learning, we know that not every workforce needs a custom eLearning course.</p>
      <p>Some workforces need the structure and space for other types of training like self-study materials, practice scenarios, microlearning, and performance support materials. Others just need help with specific tasks while developing their own training.</p>
      <p>Not ready to dive into developing training just yet? Maybe you’re an organization that needs the knowledge and expertise of our consulting team to help you craft an entire training initiative.</p>
      <p>Whatever your unique goals are, EdgePoint Learning can craft a solution that works for you from planning, to development, and delivering your training. See how we can help your organization with:</p>
