## How To Conquer Your New Year's Resolutions With SMART Goals
You've probably heard of SMART Goals at some point in time. For those of you who set New Year's goals or resolutions, now might be a good time to utilize this goal crushing approach. SMART goal setting brings structure and accountability to your goals and objectives to help you hold yourself accountable for your goal and yourself. The main elements of a SMART goal are:

- **S**pecific - Indicates the who, what, when, where, and why. Paves out the steps.
- **M**easurable - Specify what success looks like, by including measurement for reaching your goal.
- **A**chievable - Give yourself the opportunity to meet your lofty goals in a piecemeal manner to help you avoid discouragement along the way.
- **R**ealistic - Set just goals that you’re able to attain and you're invested in.
- **T**imely - Set a date! Be aggressive but make sure to give yourself time to complete the goal while also making new behaviors into habits.

Here are a couple of examples:.

**Non-SMART Goal...** "I'm going to lose weight in the New Year."

**SMART Goal...** "I will lose 15 pounds by spring break, and I will do so by working out three days a week while also reducing my food intake to 1,500 calories per day.”

See a [sample video](/demo/goal-setting/) clip explaining SMART goals created for a customer needing employee training on a new performance management process they were rolling out to several hundred locations.
