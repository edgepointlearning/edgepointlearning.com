**WebPT** offers cloud-based electronic medical records software for use in physical therapy practices, which enables practices to operate more efficiently and comply with Medicare, HIPAA, and ICD-10 regulations. Intended for use by all members of the practice on both computers and mobile devices, the WebPT Software as a Service (SaaS) model seamlessly integrates documentation, business reporting, scheduling, billing and one-stop shopping with related products and services.

## The Challenge
WebPT experienced sub-optimal results with phone-based and live training for their new account rollouts. They sought to improve customer implementation and the end user training experience by providing self-paced online training early in the implementation process.

The Company determined that this approach would increase customer end user success and comfort using the product, as well as reduce the volume of support calls. However, they did not possess in-house resources to execute the strategy.

## The Solution
EdgePoint Learning developed a self-paced eLearning course, blending WebPT software simulation with “safe practice” interactive exercises.

EdgePoint evaluated training content from recorded live demonstrations and rapidly transformed the existing assets into a series of eLearning modules – each targeted at specific aspects and job roles of a typical physical therapy practice.

Key advantages of an asynchronous training approach included time and cost savings for both WebPT and its customers, while providing customer end users with a scalable, on-demand demonstration of how to use the software. In addition, “anytime, anywhere” access to the courseware provided ongoing performance support for customer end users, greatly minimizing the need to contact WebPT technical support.

## The Results
EdgePoint developed five hours of interactive multimedia eLearning content from the ground up within a single quarter. WebPT’s customer implementation timeline was reduced by 30%. The volume of support calls was reduced by 86% per clinic per month.

The initiative also drove a 50% reduction in training team labor time (and associated costs) — from 4.5 hours of live training per clinic to 2 hours of live training per clinic.
