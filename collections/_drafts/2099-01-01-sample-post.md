Few things in business are more guaranteed to produce groans than ice-breaking or team-building activities. Why? Because most of these feel forced and inauthentic, placing employees in uncomfortable situations with strangers and forcing them to make the best of it.

The right training program empowers all of your employees—from your front-line to your executives—to make decisions that promote safety, efficiency, and productivity. It also makes that training available right at their point of need, providing mobile-ready solutions wherever they go.

## Images

SVG's and raster images are handled differently so look out!
{: .fancy-text }

### SVG

Here's a normal-width SVG:

{% svg '/assets/svg/blog/2017-05-17-what-is-mlearning-04.svg' alt='Benefits of mLearning' %}

A full-width SVG:

{% svg '/assets/svg/blog/2017-03-01-elearning-vs-traditional-learning-infographic.svg' alt='eLearning vs Traditional Learning' class='image-wide' %}
   
### Raster

Normal images are 670px wide

{% picture blog gcw/ach.jpg --alt ACH %}

Wide images are 1170px wide

{% picture blog-wide gcw/tankman.jpg --alt Calvin Tankman %}

Picture with a link

{% picture blog gcw/allie.jpg --link https://vimeo.com/357947965/62d47befc5 --alt Allison Kat %}

SVG with a link

Uh, looks like this is broken. No SVG's with links for now.

### Smaller images can be floated

Be careful on mobile sizes. They'll look weird if they float on a phone.
{: .fancy-text }

{% picture blog gcw/rsp.jpg class="float-right thumbnail" width="400px" --alt Rickey Shane Page %}
<!-- todo: figure out responsive floats? -->

{: .clearfix }

Don't forget to add a `.clearfix` class to the paragraph or block element that follows a floated image!

## Text Styles

If your new employees need equipment or software for training, make sure they have it. Do they need access to upper management or HR to ask questions? Include that in your training resources.

The **delivery method** will depend on the *information* itself. Microlearning training takes ***300% less time*** and costs 50% less for you to put together. New hires can learn on their own time (and take learning with them wherever they go). Since most employees can only dedicate 1% of their workweek to training, it's time to make those 24 minutes more effective, more engaging, and maybe even a little fun.

Since 2007, EdgePoint Learning has delivered eLearning solutions that drive your company's performance and business goals while also enriching your employee's capabilities. As an eLearning development company, we know that employee training is only effective when it's engaging. We also know that it takes a thoughtful collaborative approach between our team and yours to create successful programs that meet the needs your company and employees.
