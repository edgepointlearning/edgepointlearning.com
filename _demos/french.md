BNP Paribas is a French bank with subsidiaries located around the world. The company needed to create training that taught and reinforced standardized internal audit processes across all bank subsidiaries. Following the creation of the course in English, BNP Paribas also decided to provide a French version of the course to a large number of employees.

This demo contains a portion of the French version of the course.
