BNP Paribas is an French bank with subsidiaries located around the world. The company needed to create training that taught and reinforced standardized internal audit processes across all bank subsidiaries. Following the creation of the course in English, BNP Paribas worked with EdgePoint to create a French version.

This demo contains a portion of the French version of the course.
