IEEE is charged with providing continuing education and training to its corporate and individual members. Limited by a small in-house development team, IEEE needed a development partner to support the volume and quality of courses needed to meet the growing needs of its membership. EdgePoint created a co-development process with IEEE, leveraging resources from both companies and streamlining the joint workflow â€“ resulting in the rapid development of eLearning courses.

This demo provides a sample of a course developed using this co-development effort.
