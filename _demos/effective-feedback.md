As part of a corporate initiative to enhance leadership skills, Avis Budget Group needed to create a series of self-paced modules targeting the skills managers need to provide specific and constructive feedback to employees. The Effective Feedback training included eLearning-based instruction and scenario-based activities, giving learners the opportunity to practice employee conversations and receive specific feedback on their performance.

The activity featured in the demo was created as part of the Effective Feedback course.
