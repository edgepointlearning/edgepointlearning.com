WebPT was experiencing significant growth and found that their existing, on-site customer training was not sufficiently scalable to meet the needs of their growing customer base. WebPT worked with EdgePoint to create self-paced eLearning modules to quickly onboard and train new customers and serve as a post-training resource. The company also repurposed the customer-facing training modules as part of their own new employee training and onboarding process, increasing project ROI.

This demo highlights the use of software simulations and practice activities.
