Synopsys wanted to find an effective way to train end users on their highly technical engineering softwareâ€”and they needed a cost-effective solution with an accelerated timeline to deployment.

EdgePoint collaborated with Synopsys to use their own internal resources. Using audio and visual elements created by Synopsys, EdgePoint built a series of modules that users can take as needed.

This demo features a portion of the training, including an introductory video, content screens covering technical information, and quiz questions.
