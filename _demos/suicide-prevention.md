The high rate of suicide among Alaskan teens prompted the state legislature to require all school personnel to receive at least two hours of suicide prevention training each year. EdgePoint partnered with the Department of Education & Early Development to create a series of eLearning courses to meet the state-mandated requirement. These courses are now being shared with suicide prevention non-profits across the country.

This demo highlights eLearning content and a scenario-based activity that allows learners to apply information presented in the course.
