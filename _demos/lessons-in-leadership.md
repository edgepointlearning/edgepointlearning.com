Bloomin' Brands introduced a new training series designed to allow executive leadership to share their experiences and lessons they learned throughout their careers. To launch the series, Bloomin' Brands wanted to use a previously recorded presentation by their CEO, but with enhancements to make it more engaging and Learning Management System (LMS)-ready for delivery and tracking purposes.

This demo includes an example of the enhanced video based on Bloomin' Brands' source video.
