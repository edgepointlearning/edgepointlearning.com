The Wynn Hotel was preparing to implement a new Point of Service (POS) system for food and beverage service and needed to develop materials to support the delivery of live training to employees in various food and beverage service roles. EdgePoint created instructor-led training kits that included instructor guides, PowerPoint slides, participant guides, practice activity guides, and post-tests.

This demo includes examples of each ILT kit component.
