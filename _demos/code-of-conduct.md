E.J. Gallo Winery sought to provide training to new and existing employees on policies and procedures associated with the code of conduct required of all Gallo employees. The information delivered needed to be consistent, and the completion of the training had to be documented. EdgePoint worked with Gallo subject matter experts to create a code of conduct training program that met their business and learning objectives â€“ while vividly reflecting Gallo's visual brand.

This demo features a module that was part of company-wide HR compliance training for managers.
