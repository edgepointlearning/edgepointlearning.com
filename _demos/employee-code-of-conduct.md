Dolby didn’t want a garden variety compliance course. They needed a unique, engaging, and highly branded solution to match their company’s style.

EdgePoint partnered with Dolby to create an interactive and engaging experience, including videos of workplace dilemmas to bring the concepts to life. The full course covers all of the important code of conduct topics—harassment, discrimination, how to report violations, and more.

In this demo, you’ll see a portion of Dolby’s course with a highly stylized design, video scenes, and activities.
