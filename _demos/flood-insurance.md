Bank of the West needed to train its employees about the flood insurance requirements that apply to the various types of property loans made by the bank. The training requirements varied based on the type of loan and property. EdgePoint developed a Core and Common module to provide the basic concepts applicable to all training groups. In addition, individual scenario-based modules were developed for each specific business line.

This demo provides a sample of the Core and Common module and a business line scenario.
