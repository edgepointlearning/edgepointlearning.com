Molson Coors needed to provide training to its employees on how to appropriately represent their brands on social media and how to use Molson Coors' internal social media tools. EdgePoint developed a video-style course to provide the training with a casual tone and heavily feature the Molson Coors brand and culture.

This demo highlights social media guidelines and an overview of social media tools used at Molson Coors.
