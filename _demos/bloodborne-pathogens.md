The State of Alaska Department of Education & Early Development was challenged with the high cost and complex logistics associated with providing an increasing level of Federally and state mandated training over a large geographic area â€“ further complicated by many of the targeted learners living in remote rural areas. The Department of Education and Early Development partnered with EdgePoint to build a library of self-paced eLearning courses as a more cost-efficient alternative to providing in-person training around the state.

This demo includes a portion of Bloodborne Pathogens training required for all school staff.
