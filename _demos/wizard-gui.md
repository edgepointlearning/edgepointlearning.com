When Avis Budget Group implemented a new software system across all of their rental locations, they partnered with EdgePoint to create multiple lessons to be used in training frontline staff and managers on the use of the new system. The training included multiple scenario-based software simulations designed to allow learners to apply what they learned in real-life situations and receive immediate feedback.

This demo features software simulations used to instruct learners on the use of the Wizard GUI system and a scenario-based activity allowing learners to practice using the software in a simulated environment. The activity provides high-level direction and more detailed help when needed.
