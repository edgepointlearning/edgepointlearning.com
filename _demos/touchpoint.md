Bank of the West was preparing to roll out a new software system and needed to train employees on the new system and illustrate how it fit into the the bank's larger Customer Due Diligence initiative and regulatory requirements. In addition to developing 20 training eLearning modules to support the rollout, EdgePoint also created a number of practice simulations. The software simulations were designed to guide learners through the basic software functionality while reinforcing skills and business rules taught in the training.

This demo includes content explaining Customer Due Diligence policies and and software simulations using the TouchPoint software.
