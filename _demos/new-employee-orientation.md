SWCA Environmental Consultants provide environmental consulting services from multiple locations throughout the US and its territories. SWCA partnered with EdgePoint on developing an interactive program, as part of their efforts to streamline and standardize their new employee onboarding. The resulting eLearning course enabled SWCA to quickly introduce employees to SWCA's culture and values; review policies and procedures; and explain employee benefits.

This demo includes eLearning content focused on educating new employees on SWCA's culture.
