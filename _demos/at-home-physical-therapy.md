To create a proof of concept for prospective investors, iFIXme partnered with EdgePoint to create an interactive simulation of their platform â€“ designed to allow physical therapy patients to complete their rehabilitation sessions at home, under the direction and monitoring of their physical therapist. The proof of concept simulated all functionality of the platform.

This demo includes the full proof of concept including a tutorial, eLearning content, video demonstrations, and simulated system tracking and reporting.
