When PetSmart expanded their corporate headquarters, EdgePoint developed an interactive tour that combined a campus map with access to basic information about both the building and the different functional areas within the organization. EdgePoint combined 3D renderings and blueprints with flexible navigation and links to PetSmart's SharePoint and Learning Management Systems to provide an engaging overview of the expanded campus.

This demo highlights custom 3D models of the PetSmart campus, multiple self-navigation options, and integration with SharePoint content. Note: Links to SharePoint content are not functional as they link to content behind PetSmart's firewall.
