    "definition": "A learning experience platform, or LXP, is a system that helps curate and recommend educational content for learners from across multiple sources. It pulls from blogs, videos, and internal and external websites, offering suggestions based on a learner’s interests, job type, and goals. The LXP then adapts as the learner interacts with it, tailoring recommendations based on past use and preferred media formats, refining and customizing as it goes.",

    "definition": "While most people are familiar with the term “cross-training” for fitness, in the learning world cross-training means identifying major tasks and skills necessary to work in a specific area of your organization, and then training each employee so they can step in as needed. Cross-training aims to build the skills of everyone in the company, giving them a solid understanding of what it takes to work in different parts of the business. It empowers your employees to provide support from within, rather than outsourcing or overloading one group of employees during hectic times.",

    "seo": "What is co-development?",
    "definition": "In eLearning, co-development is training created in collaboration between a customer and an eLearning development team. Sometimes a customer knows exactly what they want created and is ready to roll up their sleeves and pitch in on the work. Or they have a team that can create projects in-house but are overburdened and don’t have the time or resources to devote to a project. Co-development allows those customers to complete their projects with the help of professional, experienced eLearning experts.",

    "definition": "Custom eLearning is training that is tailor-made for a specific company, client, business unit, or school. Sometimes what a customer is looking for just doesn’t exist, and an off-the-shelf solution isn’t going to fit their specific training needs. In these instances, custom development is ideal. By creating new training that covers the precise information necessary, you can ensure learners gain the knowledge they need, and don’t waste time sitting through information that doesn’t pertain to them. Custom eLearning can also increase knowledge retention by using scenarios and examples specific to the learners and the situations they encounter in real life.",

    "definition": "Asynchronous learning is self-paced training that can be accessed anytime, anywhere, without an instructor or facilitator. Delivery methods include traditional eLearning courses, videos, websites, knowledgebases, and discussion forums. Asynchronous learning frees learners to coordinate their training to fit their schedules and process information at their own speed. It is ideal for topics that don’t require immediate feedback or in-depth discussion and can be used to provide opportunities for learners to apply knowledge and practice new skills.",

    "word": "Synchronous Learning",
    "seo": "What is synchronous learning?",
    "definition": "Synchronous learning occurs with everyone meeting at a set, scheduled time. It can be live in-person or hosted online through videoconferencing. The ability to interact with an instructor, who can field questions and provide feedback in real-time is valuable, and some learners are more comfortable in this familiar setting. Synchronous learning is ideal for concepts requiring in-depth discussion, but is usually unnecessary for simple, fact-based information. The biggest challenges are scheduling the trainer and all learners and accommodating the training if held in person.",
