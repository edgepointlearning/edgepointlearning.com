## Background

[Bank of the West](https://www.bankofthewest.com/) focuses on the power to finance positive change by supporting energy transition, helping enable women entrepreneurs, and financing innovative startups. Serving over two million individuals across the U.S., it is one of the nation’s largest banks, yet it preserves its local feel and award-winning style of relationship banking that ensures superior customer service. Bank of the West is owned by BNP Paribas, one of the largest financial companies in the world.

## Challenge

Bank of the West had relied on dozens of instructor-led training classes to train employees in major financial regulatory areas. With the cost of instructor-led trainings in downtime and travel, coupled with the need to respond quickly to regulatory changes, Bank of the West reached out to EdgePoint Learning for help.

The company needed [finance training](/blog/corporate-finance-training/) that employees could access anytime, anywhere, while being scalable for their growing organization.

## Solution

Rather than switching from instructor-led training to a digital “voice over PowerPoint" digital course, EdgePoint Learning recommended an interactive course design, with customized case studies.

The online courses would feature accurate (and relatable) characters talking directly to the employees, as well as to the other characters in the scenarios, clearly explaining how to apply compliance regulations on the job. The design included core modules applicable to all employees and department-specific modules that highlighted the new case studies.

EdgePoint Learning transformed 50 instructor-led training classes in major regulatory areas into seven highly interactive online courses, as well as 47 interactive compliance case studies.

With EdgePoint's support, Bank of the West was able to rapidly develop and deliver these interactive compliance case studies to 15 different departments across their global enterprise, as well as the new online courses. EdgePoint Learning’s instructional design expertise, storyboarding process, and content development also created a repeatable, rapid development framework for Bank of the West to use as new regulations were put into law or existing ones updated.

After working with EdgePoint Learning, Bank of the West realized their goal of transforming their offline training initiatives into engaging online programs.
