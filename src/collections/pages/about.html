    <h2>Our approach to learning experiences</h2>
    <p>At EdgePoint, we specialize in creating killer user experiences for learners. Our learning programs don't just meet a list of basic learning objectives. Our experts examine every point of contact between your employees and their learning opportunities. We ensure there's value at every interaction, with rich, contextual, and engaging information for them to access on-demand and in the flow of work.</p>
    {% picture "blog/2019/2019-01-16-get-employees-excited-about-training.jpg", "Our approach to learning user experiences" %}
    <h3>People-centered</h3>
    <p>We build learning experiences for people. That might seem obvious, but we place it at the very center of our project strategy because too often employee training becomes formulaic, rigid, and outdated… quickly.</p>
    <p>That's precisely when employee training becomes boring. Another dreaded checkmark at the end of your employees' days, rather than an opportunity for them to grow their skills or access on-demand performance support. At EdgePoint, we don't make assumptions. Instead, our team approaches every new project with our years of training experience and your unique business needs guiding us.</p>  
    <h2>Built for your workforce</h2>
    <p>We know that what works for an on-the-ground industrial team simply won't work for a remote, deskless workforce. Our expert knowledge in <a href="https://www.edgepointlearning.com/blog/adult-learning-theory/">adult learning theory</a> and instructional design allows us to map out the best way to organize your training approach.</p>
    <p>Innovative design practices help us stand apart from the look-and-feel of traditional training. And, our focus on people means we leverage the newest learning technologies to meet them exactly where they are. </p>

    <p>It takes a thoughtful, collaborative approach between our team and yours to create engaging and successful learning experiences.

    <h3>Always up for a challenge </h3>
    <p>Providing custom solutions is what we do. As a boutique, customer service-centric organization, we are positioned to be more flexible and innovative than larger companies. Whether it’s a large-scale training program you need to design, build, and launch ASAP or an upgrade to your existing courses to be more engaging and relevant to your learners; we have a large collection of strategies, tactics, tools, and technologies to work from.</p>
    <p>Our team has built entire new technology platforms in-house, like our mobile precision microlearning platform, <a href="https://www.pinpointworkforce.com/">PinPoint</a>. We design and develop training with the latest learning tools, like augmented reality, microlearning, and location-based performance support. We employ technologies like mobile training and performance support to meet employees in the flow of work.</p>
