      <h3>Designed from research, built for learners</h3>
      <p>Our brains think and understand information in specific ways. Microlearning as a movement draws from research into adult learning theory to develop employee training that truly meets your employees' on-the-job needs.</p>
      <h3>Learning beyond the desk</h3>
      <p>With our PinPoint Workforce platform, your frontline managers can create microlearning resources, send assignments, and track completion in the palm of their hand. Your employees get a push notification when they've entered an area that requires location-specific training. Leveraging geolocation, Bluetooth beacons, and bar and QR codes, performance support materials are a tap away.</p>
      <h3>A breeze to use</h3>
      <p>PinPoint goes beyond regular microlearning; we craft precision microlearning experiences. Like other consumer apps, our tool is easy and intuitive to use. With IoT, location-based awareness, and other tools, you can create and deploy training right to the employees who need it most.</p>
