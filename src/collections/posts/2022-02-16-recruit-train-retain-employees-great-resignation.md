Trying to figure out how to retain employees during the Great Resignation? You’re not alone. In 2021, an average of 3.9 million workers quit their jobs each month through November when a [record 4.5 million](https://www.shrm.org/resourcesandtools/hr-topics/talent-acquisition/pages/record-millions-workers-quit-2021-bls-great-resignation.aspx) workers left their jobs, well above the 2019 average of 3.5 million per month. 

[Twenty percent of workers](https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2022/01/04/great-resignation-number-people-quitting-jobs-hit-record/9083256002/) surveyed said they were quitting their jobs to pursue new career paths and passions, and 25% of hospitality workers said they wouldn’t want to work in the industry again. Many restaurant and retail workers cited low pay and health risks as reasons for leaving their jobs. The [healthcare field](https://www.fiercehealthcare.com/practices/burnout-workload-and-fear-infection-compel-physicians-and-nurses-to-reduce-hours-or-leave) also faces challenges, as one in five doctors and two in five nurses plan to leave their practices in the next two years.
