Evolving your eLearning to keep up with technology may feel like a natural choice for your organization. With the increased integration of Web 3.0 and metaverse components in our daily lives, you have probably already been thinking about how you can apply this to your employee training. But how and when should you make the change to best complement your current training?

## What is Web 3.0? 
Web 3.0 is the next major stage in the evolution of the internet. To understand Web 3.0, let’s first take a look at the previous stages. 
 
### Web 1.0	
The early internet was heavily read-only and static. Most consumers were passive users, absorbing information but not contributing to it. While some tech geeks were honing their HTML skills, average internet users were discovering the power of the web for looking up information, sending emails, and connecting through early chat services, such as AOL Instant Messenger.   

### Web 2.0
Web 2.0 is also referred to as the participative social web. The last 15-20 years have seen the explosion of content created by users, social networking, and cloud computing. Some examples of applications characteristic of Web 2.0 are Twitter, Facebook, YouTube, and Tik Tok. The amount of content continues to grow at exponential rates, and advertising has become more targeted and more personal.

And the smartphone made it all mobile.

### Web 3.0
Web 3.0 is the web of the future, and there is no clear definition of what it is or how exactly it will evolve. What we do know is that it will be decentralized, permissionless (authorization from a governing body will not be required), and trustless (users interact directly without an intermediary). We’ll also see a big growth in decentralized apps, or dApps.
