Over [46% of US adults](https://www.mentalhealthfirstaid.org/2019/02/5-surprising-mental-health-statistics) experience some form of mental illness in their lifetime, and almost 44 million people in the US experience a mental health crisis each year. Of all people in the US experiencing a mental health disorder in a given year, only 41% receive help. Mental health in the workplace is a serious issue. Yet many organizations do not provide mental health training for employees.

## Why is mental health training for employees important? 

Because mental health disorders are invisible, a person can appear healthy while concealing suffering. Training helps people recognize mental distress in others and in themselves, and hopefully inspires more people to seek help. 

Mental health training programs aim to teach employees and managers about common mental health conditions and reduce the stigma surrounding them. People learn to spot the warning signs for cyberbullying, trauma, PTSD, depression/anxiety, and excessive stress in themselves and others. 

While all employees can benefit from this training, it is often given to employees in caring roles or those who interact with the public, such as: 

* Teachers
* Healthcare workers
* First responders
* Librarians
* Social workers
