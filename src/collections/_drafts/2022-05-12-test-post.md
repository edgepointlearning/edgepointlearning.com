If you have not considered suicide prevention training in the past, think about it now during National Suicide Prevention Month{.lead}

September is [National Suicide Prevention Month](https://suicidepreventionlifeline.org/promote-national-suicide-prevention-month/). You might not think that suicide prevention training is something that you need in your field of work, but suicide prevention is everyone’s business. While there are many factors that are associated with suicide, prevention begins with a conversation.

> One advantage of hands-on training is that they are applicable immediately to the employees’ jobs. They are also effective for training when it comes to new business equipment and procedures.

### Identifying risk factors

Gatekeeper training will help identify some of the risk factors for suicide. Some of these include:

* Previous suicide attempts
* A family history of suicide or mental disorders
* History of drug and alcohol use/abuse
* Access to lethal weapons
* Traumatic life experiences
* Social isolation

Suicide prevention training also helps employees know when and how respond to situations that are not necessarily an emergency (but that still require support).
