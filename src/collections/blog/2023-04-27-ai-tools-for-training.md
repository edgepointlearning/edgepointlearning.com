## How to ‚Äútalk‚Äù AI 

Before using any of these AI tools for training, be aware that you‚Äôll be learning how to communicate and work with the AI tools themselves. Put simply, you will not be able to type in a few sentences and have fully-finished eLearning courses or graphics churn out. 

Remember that we‚Äôre talking about tools, which have limitations. While many of these AI tools for training can provide helpful suggestions or starting points for content, they will not produce perfect results, and it will always be up to you to evaluate, fact check, and edit the generated content to achieve the right balance for your business needs. 

You‚Äôll also need to learn how to craft effective prompts that give clear and specific instructions to whatever tool you‚Äôre using. In general, follow these tips for building prompts: 

* **Be specific and concise**: Avoid vague or open-ended questions that can lead to irrelevant responses. Ask direct questions that are focused on the information you want from the tool. [You can learn more about that here](https://gptbot.io/master-chatgpt-prompting-techniques-guide/). 

* **Define your format and focus**: Again, be specific, whether you‚Äôre working with a drafting or a graphics tool. Do you want a paragraph, a ten-minute long course, or a list of bullet points? Do you want a formal or informal tone? What is your brand‚Äôs style or colors? 

* **Provide context**: When available, providing context can help these AI tools for training better understand what you are looking for and generate more relevant responses. For drafting tools like ChatGPT, provide relevant information such as your industry, the regulations you must follow, and your company values. 

* **Give examples**: Examples of what you‚Äôre looking for can help AI tools generate more valuable responses. Consider providing examples of the type of response you are looking for, or examples of similar questions that may be relevant. 

* **Don‚Äôt be afraid to rinse and repeat**: Often, iteration and refinement are key to getting the best results from any AI tool. Don't be afraid to give feedback, experiment with different prompts, and refine your approach over time.

Ready to get started? We certainly are! These are the best AI tools for training and development that you can use right now, along with ideas for using each one.

## ChatGPT and other drafting tools

[ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/) is an AI language model that can help your team with a variety of training and development tasks. You‚Äôve likely heard a lot about ChatGPT, and you can learn more in our full guide below. 

For your team, these are some of the smartest ways to leverage this popular AI tool for training: 

* **Generating quiz questions**: Quickly generate a set of quiz questions related to a specific topic that can help you test learners' knowledge.
* **Brainstorming learning scenarios**: Have ChatGPT brainstorm ideas for realistic learning scenarios to simulate real-world situations and challenges that you can add to your courses.
* **Providing language support**: ChatGPT can help to translate content into multiple languages allowing for easier global course rollout. (Again, always check these translations with an expert, though!) 
* **Generating content summaries**: When fed your course content, ChatGPT can generate content summaries that highlight the key points of a lesson or module.
* **Creating content outlines**: ChatGPT can generate content outlines for eLearning courses, based on your general ideas or already-developed content, helping you to organize and structure your material in a clear and effective manner no matter the length of the course. 
* **Developing topic ideas**: Know that you need to develop safety training or another big-umbrella topic? Ask ChatGPT to brainstorm all the topics the course should cover based on your workplace, location, industry, and more.

Of course, ChatGPT isn‚Äôt the only language AI modeling tool. You can also find writing and drafting support at:

## Illustration and graphic AI tools for training

Many eLearning courses and modules rely on visuals and graphics to convey key points or provide color to training. Some AI tools that can help you create more visuals include: 

1. [DALL-E 2](https://labs.openai.com/): This AI tool can create photorealistic images based on prompts. It can also produce images with specific artistic styles, modify existing images, and more.

2. [Midjourney](https://www.midjourney.com/home/?callbackUrl=%2Fapp%2F): This AI program generates images from natural language descriptions or "prompts.‚Äù With Midjourney, users can collaborate to create new worlds, fantastic characters, and unique imagery from short text descriptions.

3. [DreamStudio](https://beta.dreamstudio.ai/generate): This is an online tool that creates realistic images, art, and animations from natural language descriptions using AI technology based on Stable Diffusion's text-to-image model. 

Think beyond basic images. You can also use these tools to automate the process of creating and formatting charts, graphs, and other data visualizations, saving time and increasing accuracy for your team. 

Note: Carefully review the terms and conditions of any graphics-generating AI websites for potential copyright issues. While AI-generated images are not copyrightable, a lot of the art fed into an AI is copyrighted and some sites don‚Äôt follow copyright rules. Unfortunately, there‚Äôs a lot of legal gray area, which will continue as these types of tools become more popular.

## Towards the future 

Because the possibilities feel limitless, it‚Äôs easy to think that AI tools for training are an automatic solution for developing any type of training or professional resources. That‚Äôs simply not the case. 

Like any technology, these AI tools are best used by creative experts in the field to maximize their output, brainstorm new ideas, and automate routine or boring tasks. They can‚Äôt replace the strategic insights and creative ideas that learning experts bring to the table. And they can‚Äôt ensure that content is correct and in line with your business policies. 

In fact, [Harvard Business Review](https://hbr.org/2018/07/collaborative-intelligence-humans-and-ai-are-joining-forces) found that in a study involving 1,500 companies that robots and humans working together was the best approach, noting: 

‚ÄúFirms achieve the most significant performance improvements when humans and machines work together. Through such collaborative intelligence, humans and AI actively enhance each other‚Äôs complementary strengths: the leadership, teamwork, creativity, and social skills of the former, and the speed, scalability, and quantitative capabilities of the latter. What comes naturally to people (making a joke, for example) can be tricky for machines, and what‚Äôs straightforward for machines (analyzing gigabytes of data) remains virtually impossible for humans. Business requires both kinds of capabilities.‚Äù

At EdgePoint, we‚Äôre excited about the future of AI tools in training, too. Robots and humans working together makes sense, and we know that collaboration will shape the training industry in the future. 

If you‚Äôre thinking about dipping your toe in the AI waters to build your next course, let‚Äôs do it together. We can help you build and roll out eLearning courses, modules, and just-in-time training resources for your team.
