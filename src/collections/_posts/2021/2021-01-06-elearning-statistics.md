These eLearning statistics will shape this year and our efforts in the employee training industry
{: .featured-text }

With a global pandemic leading to lockdowns and financial struggles in 2020, companies had to pivot fast. Due to the wide array of changes and challenges, companies had to look for training that was quick to deploy, effective, and affordable. As we move into the future, these are 36 eLearning statistics that will shape this year and our efforts in the employee training industry.

## 11 workforce statistics

When it comes to workforce statistics, one thing is for sure: 2020 was a roller coaster of a year. The growth of online learning was already exploding when partial and full shut-downs sent many employees home to work remotely.

Due to this, we saw the following trends and stats:

1. [Employee burnout](https://allwork.space/2020/10/employee-burnout-has-reached-a-new-high-survey-finds/) reached an all-time high in August 2020
