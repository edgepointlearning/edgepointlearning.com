Do you need to teach your employees about [new software or processes](/blog/how-to-train-employees-on-new-system/)? Would an eLearning course make your life much easier when it came to [onboarding new employees](/blog/how-to-train-new-employees/)? You can create a custom eLearning course, specifically made to meet your training needs. We lay out the six steps every successful eLearning project follows and then share 25 of our favorite free eLearning authoring tools for graphics, audio, video, and more that you can use today to make your course a reality. Read on to find all of our tips and tools. 

## How to create an eLearning course
Before we get to the free tools, if you're ready to create eLearning content for your team, there are a few basic steps any project will follow.

### Step 1: Establish the why of your project
Simply put, what's the purpose of your training? Who's taking it? More importantly, why are they taking it? During this step, you'll want to define your [requirements and expectations](/blog/training-needs-analysis/) for the course.

### Step 2: Gather your current materials
Pull together all your existing source material for the project, including:

+  Notes
+  Current training materials
+  Videos
+  Audio
+  Images

Use this step to also identify what materials you're missing and want to create.

### Step 3: Distill your topic into an eLearning script
Use those materials to create a script based on the requirements of your project, and the topics it needs to contain. Make sure it matches the expectations you set for interactions, assessments, and employee time in seat.

Before moving into development steps, ensure your SMEs or other company stakeholders have approved the content.

### Step 4: Define the visual look-and-feel of your project
This task can often take place while you have your subject matter expert (SME) or writer creating the course script. 

Visual tasks include defining which images, colors, fonts, movements, or animations you'll use to create a course that looks cohesive.

### Step 5: Develop materials for your course
At this point, you've gathered all of the elements you'll need to create eLearning content for your team. Now it's time to develop those items: the meat of your project. 

Record any audio portions. Create graphics. Use screen capture software to create videos. The eLearning authoring tools we discuss below can get you there. 

### Step 6: Assemble into one cohesive course
And then, bring those items together. Some free software programs can help you bring all your disparate elements into one cohesive course.
After this step, you'll also send your new course out to SMEs or other company stakeholders to review, suggest any changes, and ultimately approve. 

Once that's done, you'll move your course to an [LMS or cloud platform](/blog/best-lms-for-small-business/).

You'll notice that, in those six steps, we identified a few key areas of development, namely:

+  Graphics
