    <p>Walden Pond is owned and managed by the Massachusetts Department of Conservation and Recreation, and sees nearly 600,000 visitors every year. An exceptionally deep and remarkably clear kettle lake, Walden still inspires the conservation ethic that Thoreau first articulated in his writings.</p>
    <p>The writer, transcendentalist, and philosopher, Henry David Thoreau, lived on the shores of Walden Pond for two years, two months, and two days, starting on the Fourth of July in 1845.</p>
