      <p>At EdgePoint Learning, we listen. We know it makes a difference when we accurately pinpoint your needs and wants from the beginning and translate those into your finished eLearning product.</p>
      <p>Whether your organization is a small- or medium-sized business, multinational corporation or non-profit, good learning equals good business.</p>
      <p>Your employees need access to training and continued career growth in order to succeed. That's true whether they're out in the field for an energy company, directly working with patients for a healthcare organization, or making key business decisions from the C-suite.</p>
      <p>The right training program empowers all of your employees—from your front-line to your executives—to make decisions that promote safety, efficiency, and productivity. It also makes that training available right at their point of need, providing mobile-ready solutions wherever they go.</p>
      <p>EdgePoint Learning makes that happen with our employee training solutions.</p>

      <h2 class="h3">What We Mean by Custom eLearning Development</h2>
      <p>EdgePoint Learning works with companies from a wide variety of industries—from <a href="/blog/hipaa-compliance-training/">healthcare</a> to financial services to technology to retail. All of those industries have one thing in common, though. They need training that makes their employees actually pay attention.</p>
      <p>Easier said than done, right?</p>
      <p>Right.</p>
      <p>We know that creating truly engaging and effective eLearning courses does take time and skill. Our team has years of experience developing learning programs. They approach every new project with that expertise and your business needs guiding them.</p>
      <p><a href="/blog/learning-objectives-ebook/">Foundational knowledge</a> in instructional design allows us to map out the best way to organize your training topics. Constant <a href="/blog/learning-research-2017/">research</a> into how people think and remember information provides us new insights into presenting information. And, innovative design practices help us stand apart from the look-and-feel of traditional training.</p>

      <h2 class="h3">Employee Training Designed for Your Company</h2>
      <p>Because we listen at EdgePoint Learning, we know that not every workforce needs a custom eLearning course.</p>
      <p>Some workforces need the structure and space for instructor-led training programs. Others need a blended learning approach, with a combination of instructor-led and online courses.</p>
      <p>And, we also know that sometimes you need a course rolled out fast.</p>
      <p>Our off-the-shelf eLearning library showcases our knowledge in key regulatory and compliance topics and packages them into ready-to-go courses. These courses can be released more quickly and affordably for your company. For standard topics, these can be a great option if time or budget is a challenge.</p>
      <p>Whatever your unique goals are, EdgePoint Learning has a training solution that works. Get in touch today to learn how we can help you find the one that works best for your employees.</p>
