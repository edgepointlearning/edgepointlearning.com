### Listen First
Every project begins with EdgePoint gaining an in-depth understanding of your organization’s goals – both in terms of learning outcomes and business benefits. We then help you determine where you need support and what capabilities are required – based on your subject matter expertise, company culture, and your preferred development and delivery models. From a clear understanding of your situation, we draw upon our network of learning professionals, each already certified on the EdgePoint Learning Enablement Methodology and well equipped to define, design, develop and deliver your program. Our carefully-vetted, domestic, and highly skilled talent lets you stay focused on your organization’s core competencies and leave the learning to EdgePoint.

### Plan for Success
EdgePoint mitigates project risks because we ask the right questions up front, develop realistic project plans and manage resources according to plan. We also understand that everyone involved needs to know how the process will work, what they can expect, and feel confident that deadlines will be met all-around. By explaining each step of the process and setting proper expectations with your team before we start any project, we make sure all stakeholders understand their role, when they are required to act, and what each step involves. We plan for contingencies in advance, identifying options that allow you to overcome problem areas should they arise. The result is a winning engagement for all involved that allows you to get the best possible program outcomes – every time.

### Operate with Excellence
Drawing on our years of experience in successfully delivering Training and Learning & Development solutions to a diverse group of global clients, EdgePoint relies on state-of-the-art tools and processes to deliver a solution that exceeds expectations but stays within standards and specifications. Our clients consistently tell us that we respond to their needs more efficiently and effectively than any other provider. We work smarter to optimize client involvement and then pass the related productivity savings back to you, resulting in a highly competitive value proposition to the marketplace.

### Future-Proof the Solution
In addition to accommodating change throughout the duration of a project, EdgePoint understands our clients’ need to maintain or update the finished products. We develop all content and courseware with non-proprietary tools, giving you the option to maintain control of future updates and changes. At EdgePoint, our customers return to us because we won’t lock them into an inflexible solution or force them to accept an end product that barely meets their requirements. We adapt and iterate, allowing our clients to achieve on-going positive outcomes through outstanding instruction that may be easily updated or modified to maintain efficacy and relevance.
